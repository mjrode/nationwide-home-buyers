    question: 'How quickly can you buy my house?',
    answer: 'We can typically provide a cash offer within 24 hours of receiving your property information. Once you accept our offer, we can close in as little as 7-10 days, or on a timeline that works for you - up to 60 days if needed.'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'Do I need to make any repairs before selling?',
    answer: 'Absolutely not! We buy houses in any condition - from move-in ready homes to properties that need major repairs. Whether your house has foundation issues, roof problems, water damage, or needs cosmetic updates, we\'ll make you a fair cash offer as-is.'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'Are there any fees or commissions?',
    answer: 'No! Unlike working with real estate agents, there are no commissions, listing fees, or hidden costs. We handle all closing costs, and the offer we make is the amount you\'ll receive at closing.'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'How do you determine your offer price?',
    answer: 'Our offers are based on the current market value of your property, its condition, location, and recent comparable sales in your area. We use a comprehensive evaluation process to ensure you receive a fair, competitive offer.'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'What types of properties do you buy?',
    answer: 'We buy all types of residential properties including single-family homes, condos, townhouses, multi-family properties, mobile homes, and land. We purchase properties in any condition and any situation.'
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'Is there any obligation after I receive an offer?',
    answer: 'None whatsoever! Our offers are completely free with no obligation. You can take time to consider our offer, compare it with other options, or simply say no. There\'s no pressure and no commitment required.'
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: 'Do you buy houses that are in foreclosure?',
    answer: 'Yes, we specialize in helping homeowners avoid foreclosure. We can often close quickly enough to help you avoid the foreclosure process entirely. Contact us immediately if you\'re facing foreclosure - time is critical.'
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: 'What if my house has tenants?',
    answer: 'We buy rental properties with tenants in place. We can work with you to handle the situation professionally, whether that means honoring existing leases or helping with tenant relocation if needed.'
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: 'How is this different from listing with a real estate agent?',
    answer: 'When you list with an agent, you pay commissions (typically 6%), may wait months for a sale, need to make repairs, stage the home, and deal with showings. We offer a direct sale with no fees, no repairs needed, and a guaranteed close date.'
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: 'Are you a legitimate company?',
    answer: 'Yes! Nationwide Home Buyers is a fully licensed, bonded, and insured real estate investment company. We\'re BBB accredited with an A+ rating and have been in business for over 15 years. We\'ve helped thousands of homeowners sell their properties.'
